"""
Stage 1: Implement N peer connections and see if all of them are performing the handshake automatically. Also decode their bitfield messages and see if they work.
Stage 2: Requesting pieces and receiving them. Check if full pieces are being received, persist them to file. 
Stage 3: Check if asyncio is working with multiple peers and multiple pieces. 
Stage 4: Multi file torrent downloading
Stage 5: UDP Protocol - add protocol checking, timeout for tracker responses.
Stage 6: Add frequent tracker requests + torrent completion, add GUI for percentage completed.
Stage 7: Rarest piece first algorithm + Try to improve speeds
Stage 8: Uploading(seeding) - By sending listening, sending bitfields, unchokes, chokes, listening to requests, we already have an iterator
Stage 9: Resume and pause
