# Instructions to execute the torrent client

## 1. Open the main directory(the current directory) in your environment.

## 2. In the terminal, run 'pip install requirements.txt' to install the dependencies.

## 3. Put your torrent file in the torrents folder.

## 4. Run 'src/async_client.py' i.e. in the terminal, with command line parameter as the torrent path

## For example:

### The torrent ubuntu.torrent exists in the torrents folder already

### So, I will type the following command in the terminal to download that torrent(my current working directory is the main directory with 3 folders):
(remove the single quotes)

'python src/async_client.py torrents/ubuntu.torrent'



### This will run the program.
