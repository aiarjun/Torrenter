# Instructions to execute the torrent client

1. Open the main directory(the current directory) in your environment.


2. In the terminal, run 'pip install requirements.txt' to install the dependencies.



3. Put your torrent file in the torrents folder.



4. Change the working directory to 'src' folder (you can use the 'cd' command)



5. Run 'async_client.py' i.e. in the terminal, with command line parameter as the torrent path


For example:


The torrent ubuntu.torrent exists in the torrents folder already

My current working directory is 'src' directory.

So, I will type the following command in the terminal to download that torrent:

(remove the single quotes)



'python async_client.py ../torrents/ubuntu.torrent'


This will run the program.
